                If you haven’t been living under a rock, you have probably heard of 
                CrossFit. Or if you’re like me, you think it’s a bunch of sweaty men 
                lifting heavy weights. While I’m not completely wrong about this, I now 
                know that CrossFit is so much more. Valued at $4 billion in 2015, CrossFit 
                has grown a cult following, and I’m here to figure out why (2). 
            </div>
            <div class="intro">
                <h2>CrossFit Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2000 by Greg Grossman, CrossFit is a workout focused on 
                    “general physical preparedness” for any obstacle life has to offer (1). 
                    CrossFit trains its clients by combining the basics of: gymnastics, 
                    weightlifting, and sprinting in a competitive, high-intensity environment (1). 
                    This allows specific weights, measurements, and times to be tracked for 
                    concrete goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, CrossFit is not just a hard workout. 
                    CrossFit is a lifestyle built from exercise, nutrition, and community (3). 
                    With their “garage gym” aesthetic, CrossFit has over 15,000 affiliated gyms 
                    (or “boxes”) worldwide and continues to grow and offer certification courses 
                    in training, nutrition, and medicine (3). There are so many mixed opinions 
                    on their intense workouts, but with its cult following I couldn’t help but 
                    investigate: is CrossFit really sustainable and good for you?

                <h3>The Workout, Science, and Misconceptions</h3>
                <p>
                    CrossFit workouts are crafted to mimic the sensations that athletes 
                    and fighters feel during a competition (1). I have attached one of 
                    their workouts from their website as an example of what you might 
                    find in a CrossFit box:
                    <figure> <img id="workoutimage" src="/photos/crossfit_workout.png" alt="workoutimage"> </figure>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly, there are several research articles that discuss 
                    the effects of a CrossFit workout on the body. Many address a common 
                    misconception that CrossFit may put you at a higher risk for injury 
                    compared to other forms of exercise. According to a research paper 
                    published in PubMed in 2020, CrossFit presents similar injury 
                    prevalence to weightlifting and powerlifting, with the majority of 
                    injuries being in the shoulders and knees (4). Though this may seem 
                    concerning, the mean prevalence of injuries is only 35.3% out of 1000 
                    hours of training (4). Another study from 2017 makes the comparison 
                    that about 74% of runners experience an injury per year, while about 
                    19.4% of CrossFit participants are injured per year (5). But of course, 
                    anyone is advised to have previous injuries checked out before 
                    participating in any kind of intense exercise. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    CrossFit participants also supposedly have about 7% lower body 
                    fat percentage than the average person and have more bone mass and 
                    lean muscle mass (2). I am wary at figures like this because of 
                    course anyone that exercises regularly will have a higher muscle 
                    mass and lower body fat percentage, but nonetheless it shows that 
                    CrossFit works. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of actual skill, CrossFit cannot sharpen all 10 critical 
                    areas of athleticism: cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, 
                    strength, flexibility, power, balance, speed, coordination, agility, 
                    and accuracy (6). A study published in Sport Sciences for Health only 
                    verified that Crossfit strengthens 6 out of the 10 (6). So if you are 
                    looking to specifically train speed, coordination, agility, and 
                    accuracy, CrossFit may not be the workout for you (6). I’ve learned 
                    that CrossFit is “jack of all trades, master of none” workout. 
                </p>

            <div class="popularity_breakdown"> 
                <h4>Community Outreach</h4>
                <p>
                    CrossFit doesn’t only offer workouts, they have built resources 
                    about proper nutrition and offer guidance with meal plans. In addition 
                    to that, they run kids programs, and a charitable organization that 
                    strives to improve fitness, education, and nutrition in surrounding 
                    communities (3). Gosh, what do they NOT do?! 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="conclusion"> 
                <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
                <p>
                    With all of the information above, I’d put CrossFit at a 8/10 on the 
                    Lauren Scale (an arbitrary measurement of accessibility, sustainability, 
                    and overall benefits). The way the workout is set up it allows for 
                    participants to have a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when 
                    they reach new weights, reps, and times. If you have weak knees, 
                    shoulders, or your back, I would advise against CrossFit. With any 
                    workout comes risk, and I believe that CrossFit’s risk is minimal to its 
                    overall benefits. Also if you are an athlete trying to improve agility, 
                    speed, or coordination, CrossFit also may not be for you, but for the 
                    average Gen Z NARP (non-athletic regular person) CrossFit is a great 
                    holistic workout. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Workouts aside, their focus on the holistic health experience 
                    with exercise, nutrition, and community really make it a stellar 
                    program. With over 15,000 gyms, you can probably find one anywhere, 
                    and with workouts from 5am to 6pm, there’s really no excuse not to go. 
                    Honestly, now I’m hooked and you may be seeing an update from me soon 
                    from my nearest Crossfit gym.
