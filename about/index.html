                Hi! My name is Lauren Shelby. I am a sophomore in college and a biology major. Ever since 
                the beginning of high school, I have struggled with my body image and have been incredibly interested in health and wellness. 
                Over the past six years I have explored almost 
                every different type of workout under the sun from yoga, pilates, kickboxing, HIIT, and 
                even muay thai. My diets have ranged from Whole30, to keto, to "food combining", and now gluten-free. 
                While this was fun, I was never able to find a sustainable healthy lifestyle that could make me happy and feel good. 
                </p>
                <p>
                As a college student, I don’t have time to experiment with all of the diets and trends 
                that the world has to offer. My health in general can sometimes take the backseat 
                among my list of priorities as a student. My sophomore year I started taking back 
                my health and I realized that when I feel my best I perform at my best, and I am 
                able to balance studying, exercise, and being with friends. However, there are 
                still countless fads in the health, wellness, and fitness space that dilute and 
                make it hard to know what is actually good for your body. I am here to critically 
                dissect the science behind any health trend to see if it is actually good for you. 
                thing is off limits, and I hope this can help students like me see that nutrition 
                and fitness aren’t as scary as you think. 
                </p>
